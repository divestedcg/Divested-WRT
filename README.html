<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>Why make these builds?</p>
<ul>
	<li>I need wpad-full compiled in for RADIUS support.</li>
	<li>I want extra security features that aren't enabled by default.</li>
	<li>There are no official snapshots for wrt1900ac-v1 anymore due to kernel size limits.</li>
</ul>

How often will these be updated?
<ul>
	<li>At least twice a month</li>
	<li>Sometimes weekly</li>
</ul>

Can we rely on you to provide these builds in the future?
<ul>
	<li>No.</li>
	<li>However I have been making these for quite a while.</li>
	<li>And this hardware is still some of the best around.</li>
</ul>

Why should we trust you?
<ul>
	<li>You don't have to!</li>
	<li>Patches and configs are included for you to compile this yourself.</li>
</ul>

Other things we should know?
<ul>
	<li>These are routers/APs you shouldn't run anything else on them.</li>
