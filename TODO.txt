- SELinux
  should fit fine on 6MB devices
  will need CONFIG_KERNEL_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE disabled to fit on 3MB devices
- neon? (missing the fp16 compat mode?)
- WireGuard?
- Repartition to bring 3MB devices in line with 6MB ones.
  From what I understand the values can be simply updated in the DTS.
  But sysupgrade flashes new images with current values.
  Reportedly you can flash the factory image from stock in one pass.
  Will require user intervention.
  Backup, flash to stock, flash Divested-WRT, restore backup.
  Backup restore should work fine since it is just a tar with files.
